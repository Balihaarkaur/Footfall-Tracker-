Footfall Tracker

Footfall Tracker is a computer vision-based application that detects and counts the number of people crossing a designated line in a video. It leverages **YOLOv8** for real-time object detection and tracking and provides an interactive user interface built with **Streamlit**.

Whether you're monitoring crowd movement at events, tracking people entering/exiting buildings, or analyzing video footage for **footfall estimation**, this tool offers a clean and effective solution — no hardware sensors or complex infrastructure required.
